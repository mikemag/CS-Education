Run the example from Knuth's paper to compare with his results.
Starting with secret 3632
Solution space contains 1296 possibilities.
Initial guess is 1122

Tried guess 1122 against secret 3632 => 10
Removing solutions that have no chance of being correct...
Solution space now contains 256 possibilities.
Selecting the first possibility blindly: 1333

Tried guess 1333 against secret 3632 => 11
Removing solutions that have no chance of being correct...
Solution space now contains 30 possibilities.
Selecting the first possibility blindly: 3324

Tried guess 3324 against secret 3632 => 12
Removing solutions that have no chance of being correct...
Solution space now contains 2 possibilities.
Selecting first of the last two remaining: 3532

Tried guess 3532 against secret 3632 => 30
Removing solutions that have no chance of being correct...
Solution space now contains 1 possibilities.
Only remaining possibility must be correct: 3632

Tried guess 3632 against secret 3632 => 40
Solution found after 5 tries
Done with secret 3632
