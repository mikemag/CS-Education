# CS Education

This is a collection of code and resources developed while volunteering with CS students in high school. It is largely random sample programs and variations of assignments to help both the students and teachers.

Students should use the content here to add to their learning after they've completed their assignments themselves. Many of these samples go well beyond what is needed for their related assignments, and it will usually be confusing to start here.
